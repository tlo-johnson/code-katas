type item struct {
	price float32;
	deals deal[];
}

type deal struct {
	numItems int32;
	discountPercentage float32;
}

complex pricing: calculating three for a dollar scenario
	- maintain map of items to numItems (called itemCounts) during checkout process
	- as new item is scanned
		- increment count for item in map
		- foreach deal for item
			- if itemCounts[item] % numItems = 0
				- subtract price * numItems from total
				- add discounted price * numItems to total

model handles case when you buy 4 or 5 because we only apply discounts in multiples of deal.numItems
